      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
      <p>
        Welcome! Data structures and algorithms are fundamental building blocks for building 
        various types of software and this manual explores a variety of data structures and 
        algorithms with code implementations in Java.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I put this manual together for a few reasons. 
      </p>

      <p>
        First, I wanted to have a collection of clear 
        explanations of core data structures and algorithms, along with their implementations, that can 
        be shared with other software engineers, members of the tech community and folk who are just generally interested
        in this stuff.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, I find that explaining things I think I know deepens my understanding of them. That's certainly the 
        case for this manual.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the hope is that the manual can serve as a helpful reference for those preparing for technical interviews.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        The manual is structured in such a way that anybody with high school-level mathematics knowledge, 
        particularly of simple algebra, should be able to follow along. No background in advanced computer science is 
        required, but just an interest in learning about or refreshing your knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since code implementations are in Java, it's recommended that readers have at least a basic understanding of 
        the fundamentals of Java. A good book to start with is 
        <cite>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208" class="italicised">Head First Java</a></cite>.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use the manual</h2>            
      <p>
        As the title suggests, the manual is broken down into two main sections: Data Structures and Algorithms. 
        Data Structures gives an introduction to techniques which are used to store data and 
        Algorithms introduces various procedures for solving computational problems, using data structures. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In most cases, you should be able to jump around and read specific sections out of order, but reading the manual 
        like you would a story also makes sense. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Whoever you are, I hope you enjoy the manual and come away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of 
        data structures and algorithms. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Before we dive into those, there's a brief primer on computational complexity,  
        which is used to analyse the efficiency of various algorithms and operations on data structures. That's up next.
