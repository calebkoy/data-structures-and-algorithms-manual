      <h1>Data structures overview</h1>
      <p>
        We've talked a bit about data structures, but what is a data structure? Simply put, a data structure is a 
        way of organising data so that it can be effectively and efficiently used. It can be visualised as a data container 
        which has a specific structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next few sections, we'll be covering the following data structures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="array.html">Array</a></li>
        <li><a href="dynamic-array.html">Dynamic array</a></li>        
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Before we do, it's worth noting the difference between a data structure and what's known as an abstract data type. 
        An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure which specifies the "interface" or "contract" for that 
        data structure but doesn't tell us how to implement the data structure. For example, a common abstract data type 
        is a list. Its interface might specify that it should support adding elements, removing elements and searching for elements.
        We could implement a list using a variety of concrete data structures. Two common implementations for a list are an 
        <a href="array.html">array</a> and a <a href="linked-list.html">linked list</a>.
