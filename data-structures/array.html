      <h1>Array</h1>
      <!-- TODO: add more structure with headings -->
      <p>
        An array is usually considered the most simple common data structure, because many other data structures are 
        based on or built on top of an array.
      </p>

      <p>
        An array can be visualised as a container with multiple slots which are right next to each other.         
        Here, we'll discuss a type of array known as a static array, which has a fixed size, and in the next section, we'll 
        discuss dynamic arrays, which can grow in size. 
        A static array is an array with a fixed size. The array can only hold objects of the same size.
        It's helpful to visualise the array as a block of contiguous slots in computer random 
        access memory, usually abbreviated as RAM.               
      </p>

      <p>
        Because most computers have direct references to their RAM slots, a given element of a static array can be accessed 
        in constant time. Accessing an element of a static array is also known as "indexing".
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the array below with five slots. Arrays are usually zero-indexed, which means that the first slot of the 
        array has index 0. Therefore, our array has indices 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, each of which can be accessed in constant time.         
      </p>

      <!-- TODO: insert an image of an array. -->

      <p>
        Suppose we want to update the value at index 2. What's the time complexity of this operation? Since arrays have 
        constant-time access, this is a constant-time operation, or 
        <math>
          <mrow>
            <mi>O</mi>
            <mo>(</mo>
            <mn>1</mn>
            <mo>)</mo>
          </mrow>
        </math>.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if we want to search for a particular value in an array? If all we know is the value we want and 
        we have the array, then we'll have to walk through each element of the array in turn, checking to see if it's 
        equal to the value we're looking for. This will take <math><mi>n</mi></math> steps, where 
        <math><mi>n</mi></math> is the size of the array. Therefore, 
        searching an array is a linear-time operation, or 
        <math>
          <mrow>
            <mi>O</mi>
            <mo>(</mo>
            <mi>n</mi>
            <mo>)</mo>
          </mrow>
        </math>. 
      </p>

      <!-- This could be a note -->
      <p>
        If the array is sorted, we can take advantage of this information and construct an algorithm for searching 
        through the array that takes 
        <math>
          <mrow>
            <mi>log</mi>
            <mo>(</mo>
            <mi>n</mi>
            <mo>)</mo>
          </mrow>
        </math>        
        steps, which is an improvement. One such algorithm is 
        <a href="../algorithms/binary-search.html">binary search</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        How about deleting an item from a static array? How long would this take? Well this depends. Suppose that the array is an unsorted list of numbers and 
        we need to delete a particular number from the array. Then theoretically, we need to search the entire array until we 
        find the number. This will take <math><mi>n</mi></math> steps in the worst case, where <math><mi>n</mi></math> is the size of the array. Then we'll need to delete the number. 
        Assume that this takes constant time. Then we'll need to shift all elements to the right of the deleted number one space to the left. 
        In the worst case, this shifting will take 
        <math><mi>n</mi></math> steps. Therefore, deleting an element from a static array is a 
        linear-time operation, or 
        <math>
          <mrow>
            <mi>O</mi>
            <mo>(</mo>
            <mi>n</mi>
            <mo>)</mo>
          </mrow>
        </math>.             
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps a more common way of looking at deletion is that since a static array is of a fixed size, it's not possible to remove an element from it. 
        This is exactly the case in Java. 
      </p>

      <p>
        One downside of a static array is that we're not able to append new items to it, since the size of the array needs 
        to be known in advance so that a contiguous block of memory can be allocated for it by the computer. One way to 
        overcome this limitation is to use a <a href="dynamic-array.html">dynamic array</a>, which we'll cover next.
